## Side Note Extension (sidenotex.com)

Code you will find here is all autogenerated, a mixture
of OpenAI ChatGPT and Cursor (with Claude 3.5 Sonnet). 

It is an educational repo that shows you how to build things step by step. 

I hope to get to a fully operational solution here. 

## Time Track

+ Nov 13th - started, for approx 60 minutes
+ Nov 14th - website there after another 90 minutes, with also a Chrome Extension thats currently not testable. Up till that point I edited a label or two and removed some unnecessary code, nothing more (nothing added especially). 
+ Nov 16th - 120 minutes running in circles for sendmail to work, postfix, dns edits. Ended with hosted email and terrible handling of secrets. Not a good session.
