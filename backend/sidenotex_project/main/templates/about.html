        <h2>What is sidenotex?</h2>
        <p>
            sidenotex (side notes extension) is a collaborative web annotation tool that lets teams share notes and insights about web pages 
            within their organization. Think of it as shared margins for the web, where colleagues can leave thoughts 
            and comments that are visible to everyone in their company domain.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            The main interface to sidenotex is our Chrome Extension, which lets you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>(1) <b>Add</b> annotations to any webpage in a click of a button</li>
            <li>(2) <b>See</b> your colleagues' annotations as you browse</li>
            <li>(1+2=3) <b>Share</b> insights and knowledge within your organization</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How it looks</h2>
        <p>
            <div class="screenshot-container">
                <img src="{% static 'screen.png' %}" alt="sidenotex in action" class="app-screenshot">
            </div>
        </p>
        <h2>Privacy & Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            Your annotations are only presented to others in your organization (those with the same email domain). 
            This creates a safe space for internal knowledge sharing while maintaining privacy between different organizations.
        </p>

        <h2>Get Started</h2>
        <p>Install our Chrome Extension to start annotating:</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

            </button>

        <h2>99% Generated with AI</h2>
        <p>
            sidenotex was generated with AI as a learning exercise. 
            Mainly using Cursor (<a href="https://cursor.sh/" 
            target="_blank">https://cursor.sh/</a>). 
            I am not a professional developer, so please don't judge 
            the code quality too harshly, I corrected as many issues as I could.
        </p>
        <p> What may be interesting for you is to see the prompts used, have a look
            at (prompts) where you will see all the prompts used.
        </p>
        <p> It took less than 12 hours to develop the whole project. Do embrace GenAI!</p>

        <h2>Farewell Cloud</h2>
        <p> No cloud services were harmed during development.
            sidenotes is also an experiment on no-cloud development. 
            It runs on a single VM, with sqlite database. 
            Deployment is done with the help of 
            <a href="http://kamal-deploy.org" target="_blank">Kamal</a>.
