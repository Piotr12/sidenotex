        <h2>What is sidenotex?</h2>
        <p>
            sidenotex (side notes extension) is a collaborative web annotation tool that lets teams share notes and insights about web pages 
            within their organization. Think of it as shared margins for the web, where colleagues can leave thoughts 
            and comments that are visible to everyone in their company domain.
        </p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
            The main interface to sidenotex is our Chrome Extension, which lets you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>(1) <b>Add</b> annotations to any webpage in a click of a button</li>
            <li>(2) <b>See</b> your colleagues' annotations as you browse</li>
            <li>(1+2=3) <b>Share</b> insights and knowledge within your organization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Privacy & Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            Your annotations are only presented to others in your organization (those with the same email domain). 
            This creates a safe space for internal knowledge sharing while maintaining privacy between different organizations.
        </p>

        <h2>Get Started</h2>
        <p>Install our Chrome Extension to start annotating:</p>
        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <button id="chromeStoreButton" class="pure-button pure-button-primary disabled-button">
                Add to Chrome →
            </button>
            <p class="extension-note">
