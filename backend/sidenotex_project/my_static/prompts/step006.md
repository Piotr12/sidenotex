# What happened 

Dissapointed with the mess in the code I did asked Cursor for some cleanup.

That was quick. I also used this step to pimp the email text a bit. 

And a lot of HTML/CSS updates. 

This was a blast (compared to the SMTP mess)

Do have a look at my project, see how the DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD variables are being used. There seem to be a better way to pass it through. I am using Kamal to build this, Dockerfile is there as well and a runner bin/app script. What can be refactored? 

--

This will not work, run_docker.sh is for local tests, prod deployment is done via kamal. 

-- 

Great, all is fine now. Please have a look at the text in the email. It is very very simple. Make it better, provide a link to login page. 

--

Perfect, do look at the HTML of the page as well. I would like you to update it, be more creative, modern, estetic. Not something ultra fancy but a bit better than now.

-- 

This is so good, thanks. Lets improve the signup form a bit. Label / Input / Button should all be one below another.

--

Great, but do center them in the page.

--

on the right of the top banner on the page (where nice label is on the left) add the icon.png (its a 160x160x image), its in my_static folder and gets served as a static file.

--

great, now redo login page so the form looks the same as signup page (I mean the formating, centering etc). 

--

with all the changes dashboard.html requires correction.  improve it as well. 

drop the welcome to sidenotext (its not clear thanks to proper header and footer) 

redo the form so it looks similar to login and signup one 

email/domain looks bad, make it smaller - potentialy something like "your sidenotes, in {domain} domain"? 

---

Lovely. Lets proceed, the create annotation dashboard is too large, too much whitespace, too much screen occupied. Make it smaller, separate style from signup-box as part of that.

---

pureform is the cause of spacing, make it smaller a bit. 

--

ok, lets get edit_sidenote.html adjusted so it looks same as sidenote creation on dashboard.html

--

save and cancel on edit_sidenote.html are not at same point in button, something is wrong with cancel being not correctly aligned.

--

is there an option to add a direct link that will log user with a token from the email?
