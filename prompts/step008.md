## Step008

Adding a list of annotations page. Not that easy as I need this to be avialble via a GET url of the app, but it will also need to include the url for anotation. Took us a while with Claude in Cursor to get it sorted out. 

## prompt

Lets add a new page (view) that will list all sidenotes for a given url (and limit that based on the logged user domain). I want this page to be navigable from outside (url need to be a GET parameter). If its navigated without an URL then it shows a search form, allows to enter an URL to look for. Sidenotes should be sorted, most recent on top, there should be pagination, 10 entries on each page.

your solutions is good, but there is a slight problem. frankly not entirely sure how to sort it out. 

1) the annotations are for an url, 
2) url can be having get params
3) yet for pagination also get params are to be used. 

how to sort this out. For example I want user to be able to store annotation for https://example.com/page1?param=1&param2=tomato ... and then search for it as well.

no, lets encode URL instead (your solution still uses a named param that can be used also withint the URL).
